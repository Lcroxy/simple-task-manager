# üìù Simple Task Manager (C++ + JSON + Terminal)

A basic task manager built in C++ with local data persistence using JSON.

## üöÄ Features
- Add new tasks
- View all tasks
- View task details
- Edit existing tasks
- Remove tasks

## üí° Technologies Used
- Language: C++
- External Library: [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)
- Data storage: `list.json`
- Interface: Terminal-based (CLI)

## üìö What I Learned
- File handling in C++ (`ifstream`, `ofstream`)
- JSON manipulation in C++
- Structuring reusable functions
- Control flow and input handling
- Designing small but complete terminal apps

## ‚ùå Why I‚Äôm Ending This Project
This was a personal learning project. I wanted to explore how C++ handles file operations, JSON integration, and terminal logic. I‚Äôve achieved my goals with it and I‚Äôm ready to move on to more advanced and ambitious projects. The source code remains available as a clean reference.
